# Original Files Archive
These are the original files from the inception and collaboration back in 2013

As of 3/27/2017 These files have only been uploaded as part of the transition away from storing everything in google docs to a more open enviroment such as GitHub. The files in this repo are everything related to the initial development of this project including meeting notes and initial business plan. None of these items should be edited as they are for historic preservation.

Note: The scope of the original documents where designed around the development of a specific type of software. The scope of the party itself has built on and altered these original goals so though these represent the starting point of this project, these documents should not be taken as the final stance and goals of the oranization. For that you should explore the organizations current live documents. (PUT LINK TO CURRENT LIVE DOCUMENT LIST HERE)
